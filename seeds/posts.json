You will freeze in place if you remain this way. You must not, dear. You have to move.\" \"When I go toward you it is with my whole life.\" \"Believe in a love that is being stored up for you like an inheritance, and have faith that in this love there is a strength and a blessing so large that you can travel as far as you wish without having to step outside it.\"",
